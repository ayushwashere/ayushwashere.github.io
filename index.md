Hi! I'm **Ayush Kumar**, a Computer Science student at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm interested in building useful and fun web applications as well as continue research in Systems. I'm currently an undergraduate research assistant in Big Data Systems Research Lab under [Prof. Shivaram Venkataram](https://shivaram.org/){:target="_blank"} exploring Artificial Intelligence over a distributed system. I'm also a Data Science Intern working with [Prof. Kaiping Chen](https://www.kaipingchen.com/){:target="_blank"} to study Twitter and geospatial data related to COVID-19 to asses risk-awareness of people using social media.

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayushkumar24/){:target="_blank"}.
